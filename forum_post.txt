[B]Welcome to the official thread for the Warcraft Universalis project!
[/B]
[U]Project Overview[/U]
Warcraft Universalis is an ambitious project that attempts to recreate the Warcraft universe as we know it so far. The aim of this mod is to recreate the lore from Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft series within Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis 4 engine.

[U]Bookmarks[/U]
We plan to support several different bookmarks, each centred on a notable event within Warcraft lore.

These are the bookmarks present in the mod currently:
[LIST]
[*]Rise of the Horde
[*]The First War
[*]The Fall of Stormwind 

[*]The Second War
[*]Beyond the Dark Portal
[*]The Alliance Splinters

[*]The Third War
[*]The Frozen Throne
[*]Rise of the Qiraji
[*]The Burning Crusade
[*]Wrath of the Lich King
[*]The Shattering
[*]Mists of Pandaria
[*]Warlords of Draenor
[*]Legion
[/LIST]
Support for the bookmarks after the Wrath of the Lich King are likely to only extend to country placement.

[U]Content[/U]
This section contains overviews of key gameplay mechanics and details on how it they work within the mod.

Public Release: link

The public release won't always be the most up-to-date version of the mod, rather it will be a version we have deemed as stable enough for public consumption.
