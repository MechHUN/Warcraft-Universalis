# Kil'jaeden's Scheme
#   Ner'zhul (Shadowmoon) contacted by Kil'jaeden, event to all clans to accept Ner'zhul's guidance to attack the Draenei
#   Those that accept will appear in the Blasted Lands during the initial attack
#   +50 opinion of those that have 'Allies of Ner'zhul'
#   -50 opinion of those that have 'Shunned Ner'zhul'
#   AI:
#       Blackrock (always)
#       Bleeding Hollow (always)

# 1 year
# Doubts of Ner'zhul
#   Ner'zhul doubts Kil'jaeden, Gul'dan has usurped him, Ner'zhul is replaced, kept alive to watch
#   Clear 'Allies of Ner'zhul'
#   Clear 'Shunned Ner'zhul'
#   'The First Warlocks' fires

# The First Warlocks
#   All clans get event from Shadowmoon (Gul'dan), offering them the art of demonology/necromancy
#   Those that accept will comprise the initial horde during the First War
#       Gain 'Allies of Gul'dan'
#   Those that reject it grant a CB to all those that don't on themselves
#       Gain 'Enemies of Gul'dan'

# The Shadow Council
#   Grant a buff to Shadowmoon

# Collapse of the Draenei
#   Fires when Shattrath is attacked by an Orc clan (add mission for all Orc clans whom have 'Allies of Gul'dan' for this)
#   Fires 'Blood of Mannoroth' for all clans

# Blood of Mannoroth
#   Clear 'Allies of Gul'dan'
#   Clear 'Enemies of Gul'dan'
#   Those that accept (AI except Frostwolves always accept) gain: 'Fel-infused'
#   Those that refuse gain: 'Refusal of Fel'
#   All 'Fel-infused' clans gain CB on 'Refusal of Fel' clans

# The Dying Time
#   Once all Draenei states are destroyed (add mission to encourage this)
#   Kil'jaeden ceases contact, the orcs are without an enemy with all Draenei holdings destroyed
#   All clans gain CB on one another called 'The Dying Times'

# Contact with Medivh
#   Occurs for Shadowmoon after 'The Dying Time' fires
#   Add great project called 'Dark Portal'

# The Dark Portal
#   Once the 'Dark Portal' project is complete, this fires
#   All 'Fel-infused' clans gain a random province in the Blasted lands, + 1 colonist for 10 years (to simulate the expansion in the Blasted Lands)

# The First War
#   Add CB for orcs against all states on Azeroth
#   Add minor buff for orcs until they attack Stormwind
