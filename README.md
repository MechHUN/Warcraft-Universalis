# Warcraft Universalis
Warcraft Universalis is an ambitious project that attempts to recreate the Warcraft universe as we know it.

The aim of this mod is to recreate the lore from Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft series within Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis 4 engine.

Allowing for a unique EU4 experience where the player does not simply play at altering the course of history but is in fact steeped in a whole other fictional universe filled with magic, demons, dragons and fantasy whilst retaining a very Europa Universalis feel.
