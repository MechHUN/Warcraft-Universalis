Alright. I've been working since I woke up a few hours ago on my first draft of base ideas that can be added. Noting too difficult, just a series of decisions for the Eastern Kingdoms. With something this big, and with this many different nations, you're going to need to handle it one Continent at a time. I decided to go for the Eastern Kingdom, because of how fractured it is, and also contains the largest amount of Humans, which would have the most decisions.

What I did is separate each of the kingdoms into their race, then build off each race with default decisions, and then added special ones to specific groups.

Eastern Kingdom Decisions

NOTICE: All Tagswitches will, of course, require specific cored lands, OR a base amount of development controlled by the nation, maybe BOTH, depending on the nation. Also, Technology restrictions are entirely up to the devs, so I did not include tech level requirement in them. ALSO. I ONLY go off the base bookmark. I know there are more tags on other bookmarks, but honestly, I think that one bookmark should be focused on before more are created. For me, I want the full campaign.

First off is the hardest and most populated of all the races at the original bookmark. Trolls.
(Jellyneck, Revantusk, Firetree, Smolderthorn, Vilebranch, Witherbark, Shadowglen, Mossflayer, Amani, Shadowpine, Atal'ai, Shatterspear, Bloodscalp, Skullsplitter, Winterax, Frostmane, Hakkari)

    Kobold Base Decisions

Whew, that was nuts, wasn't it? All those human kingdoms, each having their own unique decisions. Not to mention I'll be overhauling their National Ideas later! Jebus, that was a lot of work and research. Anyways, now on to something WAY easier; the Magic nations of the Eastern Kingdoms. Only two of them!
(Kharazan, Dalaran)

    Kharazan Decisions
    Form the Medivhian Empire (Empire Rank Medivh Empire Tagswitch)

That's the Magical groups done. Now we move on. Almost done, now! Now we have the three Dragonflights that actually have a foothold in the Eastern Kingdoms. They all have a shared "Draconic" decision tree, except for the Black Dragonflight, who also get their own. Of course, if my above suggestions are accepted, the land owned in the Eastern Kingdoms will belong to minor dragon factions, who will just use the default "Dragon Decisions".
(Red Dragonflight, Black Dragonflight, Green Dragonflight)

    Dragon Base Decisions
    Honor the Titans (Changs Religion to Titanic, -1 Unrest, +2% Missionary Strength)

    Create the Twilight Cult (+2 Unrest, +3 Missionary Strength)

I'm not too happy with the Dragons. I feel that the other Dragonflights should have unique decisions too, but I'll figure that our when we do Northrend. For now, let's move on. Only one large group left, everyone's favorite mountain-dwellers, Dwarves!
(Dark Iron, Thorium Brotherhood, Ironforge, Wildhammer)

    Base Dwarven Decisions
    Unite the Three Clans (Own Blackrock Mountain, Grim Batol, Aerie Peak, Ironforge, Empire Rank Dwarven Empire Tagswitch)

Wooo! Almost done. Just a few more, and we're finished. Next up Are the Troggs. For the life of me, I couldn't think of anything super good for them, but I at least thought of a two decisions.
(Stonevault, Stonesplinter, Irondeep)

    Trogg Base Decisions
    Allow Plundering (+10% Tax Modifier, +0.5 Tax Income)
    Deny Plundering (+2 Unrest, -25% Stability Cost, +5% Production Efficiency)

Next are the Titans. Jebus hell, I could be here for hours just making decisions for them, but I cut myself off at 5. I have plenty more ideas, though, but I don't think we should pour TOO much in them.
(Uldaman)

    Titan Keeper Base Decisions
    Rites of the Titans (+2 Missionary Strength)
    Pledge Defense of the Titans (-2 Unrest, +10% Infantry Combat Ability)

    Allow Corruption Magic (Changes Religion to Old Gods, +1 Unrest, +10% Tax Modifier)

    Schedule Yearly Inventor Faires (-2 Unrest, -10% Production Efficiency)
    Foster Dwarven Alliances (100 Ducat Cost, Relationship bonus with Ironforge, Reuseable every 10 years)


And that's it. All of the Eastern Kingdom. Every last single nation gone over, given special, unique decisions fitting of their race. Holy hell, this was a lot of work, and we only have one-fourth of the continents done! Anyways, I'm just glad to help, and look forward to seeing if any of this makes it in. Balance, of course, is all up to the Devs; if they want to modify or change any of these, they of course are allowed to!
